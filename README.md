# algorithms
This is a collection of algorithms and data structures written in C#. It's meant to be a personal library that I use and update across projects

All Algorithm ideas/folder structure is based of cses (link: https://cses.fi/problemset/)

This repository contains my solutions and notes for various algorithms. These implementations are primarily for learning purposes and may not always be the most optimized. The goal is to understand how to solve problems, not necessarily to write the most efficient code
